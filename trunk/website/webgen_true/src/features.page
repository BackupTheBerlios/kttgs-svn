h2. Features

<img class="left_img" src="{resource: ruines}" alt="Two Bikes, Ruines, Kos 2005"/>

The __current__ (my visions reach out...)  goal of this project is to generate 
an HTML ouput, that provides the user of the system (which is the biker who uses 
the output to bike and enjoy the tour) with all the information to do the tour.

That means:

 * Let him/her know how to get there.
 * Let him/her decide if he is able to do the tour.
 * Give means that he/she can decide he/she is still on the right way.
 * Provide means to let him/her go back, if he/she lost the track
 * Provide means to let them enjoy the tour.

h2. And, in more detail

 * XML based: The whole tour description is based on XML.
 * XML holds data to make a bunch of tour descriptions searchable in a database.
 * You can specify: technical skill level, fitness level, type of tour, duration, total distance.
 * 'How to get there' section: Tell people how to get to start point via car, train, plain, **whatever**.
 * Advise useful maps and add the image of a map that shows the tour.
 * A graphical profile of the tour is generated automatically.
 * Detailed way point information

   * Elevation
   * Distance from last way point
   * Latitude
   * Longitude
   * Pavement
   * Points of interest
   * Restaurants
   * Anecdotes
   * Direction to go at a way point
   * Unlimited numbers of images to give an impression of the tour

 * Multi-language support.
 * Using Java: multi-platform support.

h2. And?

More in the future...
