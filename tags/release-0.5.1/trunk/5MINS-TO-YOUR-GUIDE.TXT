Please remember: You will need to have Java and a working Ant build system! 

1) Edit The File build.properties
---------------------------------
You can do this by using your prefered text editor. That is described in
section 1a).

Since version 0.5.1 (please check your version!) you can use the the GUI.
How this is done is explained in section 1b).


1a) Using An Editor
...................
   In the file 'build.properties' you have to modify 2 entries.
   
   1a.1) tour.name (A Directory Name)
   ................................
   This entry specifies not the real tour name, but a subdirectory that will be
   used to hold the data of your tour. Choose a good directory name and do not
   use whitespaces here!
   
   Example (use this for your first tests):
   tour.name=my_first_tour
   
   1a.2) lang (Language)
   ...................
   If you are german set this entry to 'lang=de'. If you want to generate a
   non-german version set this entry to 'lang=en' (which will create an 
   english tour guide).
   
   Example:
   lang=de
   
1b) Using The GUI
.................
For now, the GUI is quite simple. Just select a language for the 
generated tour and type in a name for the folder.

Starting the GUI is also simpe. On the command line (aka DOS box under windows) 
type the following command:

   ant. run.config

2) Generate A Skeleton
----------------------
From the information given ind the file 'build.properties', you can generate
a skeleton of the XML file you will use for further editing. On the command line 
(aka DOS box under windows) type the following command:

   ant gen-skeleton
   
This will generate a directory named 'tour.name' (this is the name you specified
in step 1!) in the 'xml' directory. And there you will find a file named 
'tour.name'.xml (e.g., my_first_tour.xml). This is the file that describes our
new tour.

Dont open this file now. We will look at it in step 4. Because in the next 
step all the magic will happen... 

3) Generate HTML
----------------
On the command like (aka DOS box under Windows) type:

   ant gen-tour-html
   
And the magic has happened: In the directory 'html' you will now find a 
subdirectory called 'tour.name' (this is the name you specified in step 1!).
And there you will find a file named 'tour.name'.html (e.g., my_first_tour.html). 
This is the HTML representation of our new tour. Open this file in the HTML 
browser of your choice. Does it look good? I guess, that is does not. Remember 
this is version 0.5 of this project! ;-)


4) Write Your First Guide
-------------------------
To modify the tour information edit the XML file as described in 2). I have
provided a documented DTD in the './dtd' folder. This DTD will help you to
decide what you type where. Also, the generated skeleton will use all allowed
tags and attributes.


5) Add Images
-------------
Since version 0.5 images are support. Add them to the folder 'images'. Do
NOT USE the folder 'images_intern'!!!. In the XML you address these pictures
by their file names. Do not add the folder name 'images'.

6) Repeat
---------
Repeat with 3) thru 5) until you are satiesfied... ;-)

7) Modify The Look
------------------
It's simple to change the design of the outputted HTML: You just need some
knowledge of the CSS language. For further information please read
THE-CSS-SYSTEM.TXT.
