The process of documenting and generating a KTTGS tour is described in detail in the
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/docman/display_doc.php?docid={customVar: manual_doc_id}&group_id=4839">Current German Manual</a>.

I am sorry that there is no english manual right now.
I hope I can provide some in the near future. If someone
wants to do the translation go ahead. The TeX sources are
in the subversion repository. It would be also no
problem to send them via email... ;-)

For a first quick intro you can read the following files which are
packaged in the zip file of the base distribution 
(see also <a href="{relocatable: /download.page}">Download</a> 
section):

* 5MINS-TO-YOUR-GUIDE.TXT
* REQUIREMENTS.TXT
* THE-CSS-SYSTEM.TXT
