I do the whole project as a one man show. I would
appreciate every helping hand. So don't hesitate to
contact me if you want to join the project.

The current sources you can retrieve from the
Subversion repository at Berlios via 
**svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/kttgs**.

You will find an ANT __build.xml__ file in
the checked out source tree.
