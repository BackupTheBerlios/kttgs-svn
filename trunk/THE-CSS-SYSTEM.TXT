[[This is THE-CSS-SYSTEM.TXT]]

The current layout system is quite simple:

a) We have a number of CSS files in the 'css' subdirectory. You can name your
   css-file whatever you want, but please leave the original 'biketour.css' 
   intact!

b) In file 'build.properties' we have an entry named 'css'. Change this for
   example to:
   
      css=my_super_cool.css
      
   Where 'my_super_cool.css' is the filename you have choosen.
   
Done you are. In the process of building the HTML from your XML the css file
will be copied to the location where the HTML file will be generated.
