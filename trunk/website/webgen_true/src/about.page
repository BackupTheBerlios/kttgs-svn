h2. About KTTGS (v{customVar: version})

I like to do bike tours with my mountainbike. And I have discovered that there is 
a lot of tour information out there in internet. Some tour guides are done very
well.. but some lack a lot of information. And, all are presented in a layout the
specific author decided to be **top notch**...

Since I am a software developer I like some structure in the material I read. And,
since I am also a biker who wants to show his **cool** tours to others, I decided
to start this project.

This face... is me. The picture was taken while I was on a 
snowboarding trip to Kirchberg, Austria. That was
in January of 2006. We had a masses of snow, lot
of sun and big fun.

The sun glasses I bought at Whistler/Blackcomb, CA.
Great area to do downhills I was told... but again, I 
was there to smash my snowboard. Btw, nice people, these 
Canadians.

And yes, my dreadlocks are all natural hair and still
growing (since 9/11, been to Jamaica on that day)...

I guess you now understand why my nick reads __knottyTom__.
